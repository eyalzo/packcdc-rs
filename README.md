This project implements PACK CDC algorithm, as presented in our 2011 SIGCOMM paper [The power of prediction: cloud bandwidth and cost reduction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2043164.2018447).
It is a high-speed anchoring algorithm, running even faster than the known ISA-L implementation of Rabin's fingerprint.
Feel free to try...
