## High-Speed Anchoring with PACK CDC Algorithm (Rust)

This repository provides a Rust implementation of the **PACK CDC algorithm**, a high-speed anchoring algorithm for data streams. 

**PACK CDC** was introduced in the SIGCOMM 2011 paper "[The power of prediction: cloud bandwidth and cost reduction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2043164.2018447)" by my team and myself.  Written in Rust, this implementation leverages Rust's strengths for performance, making it even faster than existing solutions like ISA-L. This translates to efficient processing of large data streams in real-time.

**What is Anchoring?**

In data stream processing, anchoring refers to a technique for efficiently verifying the integrity of a data stream. It involves generating a concise fingerprint that captures the essence of the data and allows for later verification without requiring the entire stream to be stored.

**Benefits of PACK CDC (Rust):**

* **Extreme Speed:**  Rust's focus on performance optimization makes this implementation of PACK CDC exceptionally fast, surpassing even the speed advantages of the Java version. 
* **Scalability:** The algorithm is designed to handle real-time data streams, making it suitable for high-volume data processing scenarios.
* **Improved Efficiency:** By minimizing processing time for anchoring, PACK CDC contributes to overall system efficiency and resource optimization.

**Potential Applications:**

* Real-time data stream verification in network traffic analysis.
* Content integrity checks for data delivery in content distribution networks (CDNs).
* Secure data auditing in cloud storage systems.

**Further Research:**

This repository provides a foundation for exploring the PACK CDC algorithm and its potential applications in various data stream processing domains. We welcome contributions for:

* Integration with real-time data stream processing frameworks.
* Performance evaluation and comparison with other anchoring algorithms.
* Exploration of new use cases for PACK CDC in data security and integrity verification.
